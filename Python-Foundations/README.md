## Learning Objectives

### Part 1: Python Data Types
 
- Discuss Python as a programming language
- Define integers, strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries
- Demonstrate arithmetic operations and string operations
- Demonstrate variable assignment 

### Part 2: Python iteration, control flows, and functions
 
- Define `Python` control flow and conditional programming.  
- Implement `For` and `While` loops to iterate through data structures.
- Apply `if, else` conditional statements.
- Create functions to perform repetitive actions.
- Demonstrate error-handling using `try, except` statements.
- Combine control flow and conditional statements to solve the classic "FizzBuzz" code challenge.
- Use `Python` control flow and functions to help us parse, clean, edit and analyze the Coffee Preferences dataset.

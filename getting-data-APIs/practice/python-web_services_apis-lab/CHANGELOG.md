### v0.1 | 06.27.17

_Editor: Sam Stack_

- Added CHANGELOG.md 

- Added '.DS_Store' & '*.ipynb_checkpoints' to .gitignore.

- OMDB is no longer free so lab was adjusted to use the TVmaze API.  The last two aspects had to be removed from the lab as they were no longer relevant

- original lab solutions are in a folder in the solution folder.
